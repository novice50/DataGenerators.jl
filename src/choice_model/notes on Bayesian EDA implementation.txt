(1) Conditional Sampler
	- definition
	- sampling
	- re-estimation
	- implement as single parent
	
(2) Model Building

	- perhaps use parallel computation features of Julia, borrowing technique from my GPGPU implementation (and for other tasks such as model updating at each node)
	- note: because of taking last value and allowing "nothing", we can permit cyclic network?  if so, we can easily parallelise
	- should default sampler simply use given (default) parameters, or be estimated from entire set of traces?
	- can skip nodes with 0 parameters
	- single parent conditional, so can model building should look for nested
	- this enable, in theory, each nested conditional to be have a different parent (i.e. for value of outer primary): let this be an option
	- note: trace doesn't contain gn [check?] but need it for model building (inc. to change parents in Conditional sampler) - either need to pass godelsequence, or add to trace

(3) Advanced
	
	- something decision tree-like for efficient storage of conditional probs?

> sampler must implement:

	* numparams
	* setparams
	* paramranges
	* getparams
	* sample (takes choice context)
	* estimateparams (takes traces for this cpid) - NEED TO CHANGE THIS
	* amendtrace (for when fallback is ued - needs to "fake" original value)
	
> relevant data

	* cpid is UInt - COULD CHANGE THIS TO SYMBOL
	* choicepointinfo(g) returns (cpid, info)
	* sampler choice model is dictionary of samplers by cpid
